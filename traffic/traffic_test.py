"""
To make a model for traffic systems that can be used for dynamic testing of new control patterns.

A non-exhaustive list of what this will incorporate:
    different vehicles
    different drivers
    different traffic controls
    ai for best traffic through area
    costs of construction for most efficient upgrades
    impacts of weather

Goal:

To be able to predict real world traffic patterns in a program.

Secondary goal:

To use programmatic prediction to make traffic more efficient.

Applications:
    Transportation of goods
    Transportation of services
    Transportation of peoples
    Traffic emulation in video games

Research:
    Microscopic: how small parts will affect a whole.
    Mesoscopic: how smaller groups of parts will affect a whole.
    Macroscopic: how the whole works.
    Metascopic: ???

    Car following models:
        Intelligent driver models
        Gipps' model
    Discrete event and continuous time:
        Using differential equations:
            Simple: Euler's method
            More complex: Taylor's series methods:
                Heun's method
                Runge-Katta
